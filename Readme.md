## 2D-KTL and Autonomous agents 

1. **2D-KTL_configs** – Contains configuration files for training MoS₂ and graphene datasets.  
2. **MoS2_data** – Includes the MoS₂ dataset used for training and evaluation.  
3. **graphene** – Stores the Graphene dataset for model training and testing.  
4. **WS2_data** – Stores the WS2 dataset for model training and testing.  
5. **multiagent** – Contains the code for intelligent agents used in the project.  
6. **Model Training Reference** – The training process primarily follows the [MMsegmentation](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmsegmentation) framework from OpenMMLab, which provides a modular and extensible pipeline for segmentation tasks.  

This project focuses on developing lightweight deep learning models for layer identification in 2D materials, specifically MoS2 ,WS2 and graphene films.
